Notes:
	A large, high-current diode at the charger input prevents shorting the battery.

	The logic power switch removes power to the regulator. When switched "off", the only waste power is leakage current is through the main MOSFET, which is very very low. When switched "off", the switch connects to the charger input. (Even when switched off, the 5V logic will be powered up if the charger is connected.)
	
	The 5V Input V Meas is used as pack voltage measurement when the system is switched on. When switched off, it is disconnected from the battery, and connected to the charger input. 

	When the charger is connected, the Charge and 5V Input V Measurements are compared in software. If they are equal (i.e., logic switch is set set to "off", system should be in a "Charge Only" mode. If the logic switch is set to off, the system is powered on and the charger is disconnected, the system will suddenly shut off (as power to the 5V logic would be lost).

	With the Logic switch on, the system may be simultaneously run and charged. This is not necessarily recommended, as it may (or may not) cause odd charger behavior, depending on the external charger. 

	The ATTiny 828 uses ICSP pogo pads for programming. A solder jumper connects the ATTiny to the 5V supply, so it a pogo programmer can be used without affecting everything else connected to the 5V line.
