        The Missouri S&amp;T Mars Rover Design Team (MRDT) was established in 2012 to compete in the University Rover Challenge (URC) hosted by The Mars Society.
        URC expects rovers to perform a number of tasks in the southern Utah desert in conditions analogous to those that would be expected in and around colonies on Mars.
        In two short years we have become the leading Mars rover design team in the U.S., and second in the world.
        This feat would not be possible without Missouri S&amp;T, the generosity of our sponsors, and the dedication of our members.<br><br>
        In the time between competitions, MRDT commits to a year-long design, fabrication, and integration process.
        MRDT operates completely on donations from sponsors and our university in order to see our rovers realized.
        Our current rover, <i>Horizon</i> (shown below), competed in URC 2015 and the European Rover Challenge 2015.
        It features components designed entirely by members of our team, such as:
        <ul>
          <li>A water-jetted aluminum chassis</li>
          <li>3D-printed differential gears for the robotic arm</li>
          <li>80 lithium-polymer battery cells</li>
          <li>Custom Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) for communication, battery management, and power distribution</li>
        </ul>

        At the top of the pyramid sit our team-elected executive officers who appoint leads for each of MRDT's
        sub-teams.
        This hierarchical structure is similar to real-world business, but we are not a business.
        Every member dedicates their time solely for the invaluable experience provided by building a Mars rover.

        Donations to the team are monetary or in-kind.
        In the past, donations-in-kind have come in the form of tools, materials, and consultancy.
        Monetary donations are used by the team to acquire needed tools and materials for prototyping and fabrication.
        They also cover cover administrative costs for public relations and travel.
        If you are interested in donating, please see our donation instructions. <br /> <br />
