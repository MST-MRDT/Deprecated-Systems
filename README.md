# RoveComm-Software
Distributed Internet Protocol for Embedded Device 

Inside the C folder is a bit of C code for communicating with UDP so we only need one board. The energia folder has our communications template for communuicating on the TI boards.

To use the RoveComm library, open energia and change File -> Preferences -> sketchbook location to the location of your project, then copy libraries/rovecomm/ to your project directory  

#### Communications Protocol
The bytes of the packet message are ordered like this:

| Version | Sequence # | Data ID | Data Size | Data      |
|:-------:|:----------:|:-------:|:---------:|:---------:|
| 1 Byte  | 2 Bytes    | 2 Bytes | 2 Bytes   | 0-N Bytes |

Version: Protocol Version  
Sequence #: For back and forth communication (currently unused)  
Data ID: Identification for data being transmitted  
Data Size: Number of bytes in the Data section  
Data: Raw data being transfered
