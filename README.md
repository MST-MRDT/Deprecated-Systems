2. Install the Xbox controller driver
    sudo apt-get instal xboxdrv
3. Clone the repo to your raspberry pi
    git clone https://github.com/MST-MRDT/DriveBoard-PR.git
4. Mark the file as executable
    chmod +x DriveBoard-PR/xbox_remote_control.py

# Running

    python xbox_remote_control.py

After running this command
1) Your xbox controller should indicate a connection
2) Log information will be dumped to the console
3) Rovecomm messages will begin streaming to the drive board over UDP

Press `ctrl-c to exit`

# Enabling Autostart

Setting the program to run at startup is highly recommended.

Raspbian wheezy uses SystemD to control which programs run at startup.
SystemD is a bit of a pain, and unfortunately there's no easy way to put this
part in the repo.

1) Create the file `/etc/systemd/system/xbox_remote.service`

        [Unit]
        Description=Allows driving the rover through an Xbox controller
        After=multi-user.target
        After=network.target
        
        [Service]
        ExecStart=/home/pi/DriveBoard-PR/xbox_remote_control.py
        WorkingDirectory=/home/pi/DriveBoard-PR
        Type=idle
        Restart=always
        
        [Install]
        WantedBy=multi-user.target

2) Set the file permissions

        sudo chmod 644 /etc/systemd/system/xbox_remote.service

3) Enable the service

        sudo systemctl daemon-reload
        sudo systemctl enable xbox_remote.service
        sudo reboot

To view program output logs

    sudo systemctl status xbox_remote.service
